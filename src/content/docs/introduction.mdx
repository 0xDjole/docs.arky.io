# Welcome to Arky

**Arky** is an all-in-one business platform that provides everything you need to build modern web applications with content management, e-commerce, booking/reservations, and newsletter capabilities—all accessible via a unified REST API and TypeScript SDK.

## What is Arky?

Arky combines four core systems into a single, cohesive platform:

- **Headless CMS**: Flexible content management with a unified Blocks system for structured data
- **E-commerce**: Full-featured online store with products, variants, orders, carts, and checkout
- **Reservations**: Service booking and appointment scheduling with providers, time slots, and availability management
- **Newsletters**: Email campaigns with subscriber management and delivery tracking

All of these systems share:
- **Unified authentication** (JWT, API keys, guest tokens, OAuth via Google)
- **Flexible pricing** with multi-market and multi-currency support
- **Blocks-based data model** for forms, custom fields, and dynamic content
- **Real-time capabilities** via WebSocket notifications
- **Rich media management** with S3 storage and automatic resolutions
- **Analytics** via ClickHouse for business insights

## Why Arky?

### 1. **One Platform, Multiple Use Cases**

Instead of stitching together separate services for CMS, e-commerce, bookings, and email—each with different APIs, auth systems, and billing—Arky provides a single, unified API surface.

### 2. **Headless & Framework-Agnostic**

Arky is fully headless. Use it with:
- **Astro** (as seen in the website example)
- **React** / **Next.js**
- **Vue** / **Nuxt**
- **Svelte** / **SvelteKit**
- Or any JavaScript/TypeScript framework

### 3. **Blocks System**

A powerful, type-safe field system inspired by modern CMS tools. Define forms, product attributes, reservation metadata, and more using reusable "blocks" (Text, Number, Boolean, Relationship, GeoLocation, etc.).

### 4. **Multi-Market & Multi-Currency**

Built-in support for:
- **Markets** (e.g., US, EU, UK) with distinct currencies, tax modes, and payment methods
- **Zones** (geographic groupings) with country-based shipping and tax rules
- **Market-based pricing** on products and services

### 5. **Built for Scale**

Arky is built for production from day one:
- **Distributed & highly available** across multiple regions
- **Fast** with automatic caching and optimized queries
- **Reliable** with automatic backups and 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Secure** with SOC 2 compliance and data encryption at rest

```

**Your app connects to Arky via:**
- **TypeScript SDK** (`arky-sdk`) for frontend apps
- **REST API** (`api.arky.io`) for any language/framework
- **Webhooks** for real-time event notifications

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the API reference, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

- **Business**: Top-level tenant. Each business has its own data, users, roles, and configurations.
- **Markets & Zones**: Multi-region pricing and tax/shipping rules.
- **Blocks**: Typed fields for dynamic forms and structured content (think Notion-style blocks).
- **Collections & Entries**: CMS content is organized into collections (like content types) and entries (like posts/pages).
- **Products & Variants**: E-commerce catalog with multi-attribute variants and market-based pricing.
- **Services & Providers**: Reservation system entities (e.g., "Haircut" service with multiple stylists as providers).
- **Quotes & Checkout**: Unified payment flow across e-shop and reservations with promo codes, shipping, and tax calculation.
